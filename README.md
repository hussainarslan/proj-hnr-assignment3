## Process Requirements in Open Sources Projects 
### Explored by: Noureen Fatima

### Issue 1: Study about Versoning and Release Management 
Identification and tracking of system versions are key components of the version and release management process. The purpose of such processes is to **prevent the development team from unintentionally changing versions of a system that may be retrieved when needed.**

Versions of the system could possibly have altered functionality, improved performance, or fixed software bugs. Although they may work similarly, several versions may be made for various hardware or software configurations.


* **Variants** are occasionally used to describe versions that only have slight changes.
* A distributed version of a system is also referred to as a **system release**. Every system update should either bring in new features or be tailored to a certain hardware platform.
* A system typically has far more releases than versions. **Versions** are produced by a company for internal testing or development purposes only; they are not meant for customer release.
* **Version identification:** You must define the versions of the system components that should be included in a system in order to produce a particular version of that system. There are hundreds of software components in a complex software system, and each one could have numerous different versions. To ensure that the proper components are used in the system, there must be a clear means to identify each component version.
