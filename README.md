## Process Requirements in Open Sources Projects 
### Explored by: Noureen Fatima

### Issue 7: Study about Versioning and Release Management 
Identification and tracking of system versions are key components of the version and release management process. The purpose of such processes is to **prevent the development team from unintentionally changing versions of a system that may be retrieved when needed.**

Versions of the system could possibly have altered functionality, improved performance, or fixed software bugs. Although they may work similarly, several versions may be made for various hardware or software configurations.


* **Variants** are occasionally used to describe versions that only have slight changes.
* A distributed version of a system is also referred to as a **system release**. Every system update should either bring in new features or be tailored to a certain hardware platform.
* A system typically has far more releases than versions. **Versions** are produced by a company for internal testing or development purposes only; they are not meant for customer release.
* **Version identification:** You must define the versions of the system components that should be included in a system in order to produce a particular version of that system. There are hundreds of software components in a complex software system, and each one could have numerous different versions. To ensure that the proper components are used in the system, there must be a clear means to identify each component version.

### Issue 8: Study Techniques for Component Version Identification
* **Version Numbering:** In a version numbering scheme, the component or system name is followed by a version number. If version 1.0, then versions 1.1, 1.2, and so forth will follow. At some point, a new release (release 2.0) is made, and the process starts over at version 2.1. The plan is linear and is based on the notion that system versions are produced one after another. This method of version identification is supported by the majority of version management software, including RCS and CVS. ![image link](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210107091720/517.png)

* **Attribute Based Identification:** It is simple to add new versions that are descended from any of the existing versions if each version is recognised by a distinct set of attributes. These are recognised by means of a distinctive set of attribute values. Most of the attributes are shared with their parent version, preserving linkages between versions. By indicating the necessary property values, specific versions can be retrieved. The last version created or the version created between supplied dates are supported via functions on attributes. Version management systems may implement attribute-based identification directly, with component attributes preserved in a system database. Alternately, a secret version-numbering technique may be developed as a layer on top of the attribute identification system.

* **Change Oriented Identification:** In attribute-based identification, each component is referred to by its name, but it also has a connection to one or more modification requests. Consequently, it is presumptive that each version of a component was developed in response to one or more change requests. Change requests that pertain to components are used to identify a component's version.

### Issue 9: Explore versioning in Webswing
* All the releases are accessible on the website. For example, from release **20.1 to 22.2**.
* Not only each release is mentioned, but also all installation guides, and release notes are present. 
* Dates are also mentioned in each versionâ€™s release.
* Moreover all the major changes are mentioned. 
* **Conclusion:** Webswing manages its releases and versions very well. Everything is organized and easy to understand. Everything is well documented.

## Architectural and Component Level Modularity in Open Source Projects
### Explored by: Hussain Arslan

### Issue 3: Microservices
* **What are microservices?**
Microservices are an architectural and organisational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over
well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.

* **Benefits of microservices**
1. Highly maintainable and testable - enables rapid and frequent development and deployment

2. Loosely coupled with other services - enables a team to work independently the majority of 
time on their service(s) without being impacted by changes to other services and without 
affecting other services

3. Independently deployable - enables a team to deploy their service without having to 
coordinate with other teams

4. Capable of being developed by a small team - essential for high productivity by avoiding the 
high communication head of large teams

5. Enables the continuous delivery and deployment of large, complex applications.
   - Improved maintainability - each service is relatively small and so is easier to understand 
   and change
   - Better testability - services are smaller and faster to test
   - Better deployability - services can be deployed independently
   - It enables you to organise the development effort around multiple, autonomous teams. Each 
   (so called two pizza) team owns and is responsible for one or more services. Each team can 
   develop, test, deploy and scale their services independently of all of the other teams.

6. Each microservice is relatively small:
   - Easier for a developer to understand
   - The IDE is faster making developers more productive
   - The application starts faster, which makes developers more productive, and speeds up 
   deployments

7. Improved fault isolation. For example, if there is a memory leak in one service then only 
that service will be affected. The other services will continue to handle requests. In 
comparison, one misbehaving component of a monolithic architecture can bring down the entire 
system.

8. Eliminates any long-term commitment to a technology stack. When developing a new service you 
can pick a new technology stack. Similarly, when making major changes to an existing service you 
can rewrite it using a new technology stack.

* **Microservices in WooCommerce**

Considering all the information above about microservices, WooCommerce has implemented these to 
supplement the user experience and make it easier to add a lot of different functionalities to 
their product by using them. Some of these examples include eBay integration for WooCommerce, 
estimated delivery date and time and even currency switcher. 

[Plugins - WooCommerce - WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/)

Above is a link for some plugins that are used by WooCommerce and may be considered 
microservices. Furthermore, there are some APIs used by WooCommerce. These include Stripe, 
WooSidebars, In Stock Notifications, Pre-Orders and Google Listings & Ads.

### Issue 4: Extensibility
* **What is Extensibility?**

Extensibility is a software engineering and systems design principle that provides for future growth. Extensibility is a measure of the ability to extend a system and 
the level of effort required to implement the extension. Extensions can be through the addition of new functionality or through modification of existing functionality. 
The principle provides for enhancements without impairing existing system functions.

An extensible system is one that is not affected by modifications in functionality and retains current behaviour

* **Extensibility in VueStorefront**

VueStorefront has a lot of integrations which add on to the basic functionality of VueStorefront 
and their addition does not affect the base functionality. All of these make Vue Storefront 
highly extensible. These integrations are available on the link below:

[Integrations - VueStorefront](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/v2/integrations/)

### Issue 5: Reusability
* **What is Reusability?**

Reusability is the use of existing assets in some form within the software product development 
process. These assets are products and by-products of the software development life cycle and 
include code, software components, test suites, designs and documentation. The opposite concept 
of reusability is leverage, which modifies existing assets as needed to meet specific system 
requirements.

* **Reusability in Ansible**

Ansible has implemented reusability in a very intuitive and effective way. Ansible offers two 
ways to reuse files and roles in a playbook: dynamic and static. Ansible offers four 
distributed, reusable artefact: variable files, task files, playbooks, and roles.

1. A variables file contains only variables.
2. A task file contains only tasks.
3. A playbook contains at least one play, and may contain variables, tasks, and other content. 
You can reuse tightly focused playbooks, but you can only reuse them statically, not 
dynamically. 
4. A role contains a set of related tasks, variables, defaults, handlers, and even modules or 
other plugins in a defined fil-tree. Unlike variable files, task files, or playbooks, roles can 
be easily uploaded and shared through Ansible Galaxy.

In ansible, you can even incorporate multiple playbooks into a main playbook. However, you can 
only use imports to reuse playbooks. Importing incorporates playbooks in other playbooks 
statically. Ansible runs the plays and tasks in each imported playbook in the order they are 
listed, just as if they had been defined directly in the main playbook.

## Performance Optimizations in Open Source Projects
### Explored by: Hussain Arslan

### Issue 10: Usage of Lazy Loading
* **What is lazy loading?**

Lazy loading is the practice of delaying load or initialization of resources or objects until 
theyâ€™re actually needed to improve performance or save system resources. Lazy loading is a 
technique used to prevent or delay the loading of non-critical resources until they are needed. 

* **Usage of lazy loadin in VueStorefront**

In vue storefront lazy loading can be used for different types of resources, but in the case of 
images, the goal is to lazily load everything that is not visible to the user within the initial 
viewport. All other images can be loaded when the user scrolls down the page. A code snippet for 
this can be found on the following link
